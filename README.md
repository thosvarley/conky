# Modular conky sidebar
A modular conky sidebar for keeping an eye on system behavior. 

Each piece of the sidebar is defined in its own configuration file in the `configs` directory. You can change the order in the `buildconky.sh` script.

To compile a new master `conky.conf`, run `./buildconky,sh`. To start it, run `./startconky.sh`.
